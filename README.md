It includes a detailed Jupyter notebook demonstrating the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification on the Breast Cancer dataset from scikit-learn. Key steps covered are data preprocessing, model training with different kernels (linear, polynomial, radial basis function), performance evaluation through accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, visualization of decision boundaries with support vectors, and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to find the best SVM parameters.
